<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>UseBy – Track Your Expiry Date</strong> respects your privacy.</p>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>UseBy does not collect, store, or share any personal data.</p>
<p>All expiry items, subscriptions, EMI records, and savings entries you add are stored locally on your device.</p>

<h2>Camera Permission</h2>
<p>The app may request camera permission only to help users quickly add expiry details. No images or data are uploaded or stored on any external server.</p>

<h2>Notification Permission</h2>
<p>The app may request notification permission to send reminders for expiry dates, subscriptions, EMI payments, and savings tracking.</p>
<p>All notifications are generated locally on your device based on your selected reminder settings.</p>
<p>No notification data is transmitted to any external server.</p>

<h2>Notifications/Reminders</h2>
<p>UseBy uses local notifications/reminders to alert users about upcoming expiry dates, subscription renewals, EMI due dates, and savings milestones.</p>
<p>Notifications/Reminders are scheduled and generated directly on your device based on your selected settings (such as 7 days before, 3 days before, on the due date, etc.).</p>

<p>Users can enable or disable notifications/reminders at any time from the app settings.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All data remains securely stored on your device. The app works completely offline.</p>

<h2>App Lock & Authentication</h2>
<p>UseBy provides an optional app lock feature for additional privacy.</p>
<p>Users can customize when authentication is required (for example: every time the app is closed, or once every 24 hours).</p>
<p>If the 24-hour option is selected, the app will remain unlocked for 24 hours after successful authentication.</p>
<p>Authentication data is handled securely by your device and is not stored or transmitted by the app.</p>

<h2>Appearance Settings</h2>
<p>Users can enable or disable theme settings (Light Mode or Dark Mode) within the app. Theme preferences are stored locally on your device.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>UseBy does not use third-party analytics, ads, tracking services, or cloud storage.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The app does not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>
